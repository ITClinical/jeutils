# jeutils

This is a fork of the [JEUtils tool] (https://sourceforge.net/p/jeutils).

JeUtils is an open source program that can be used to automate queries to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using both eUtils and BLAST queries.

Since the original tool is no longer maintained, feel free to contribute to this fork!
